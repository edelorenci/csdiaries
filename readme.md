## Description

CHILDREN'S SCIENCE DIARIES

Project P4 for Dynamic Web Applications Course / Harvard Summer School 2014

* Purpose:

The application is a repository for children's science diaries. A science diary is related  
to an experiment or particular study. 

The users can create diaries; add information to a diary and view theirs diaries.

* Motivation:

I have a friend who is an elementary school teacher in a public school located at a very 
poor area in the city where I live. Many children in that school have a sad reality. 
This teacher has been developing a creative project for getting the students focused 
in learning. The application is  intended to be a complementary tool for science classes. 

This project was inspired by my daughters' curiosity.

## Details for teaching team

The project is in its first stage. The features described in the Purpose Section are 
implemented.  

The second stage (to be implemented) will have the following functionalities:

- Upload multiple pictures. 

Each page can have many pictures. The actual database tables and
ORM models support this relationship.

- Search Science Arquives.

The users will have the option to turn their diaries public. Public diaries will be searched 
by keyword. The Search Science Arquives feature will be available to anyone, even for 
no authenticated users.

- Print diary.

A PDF version of the diary will be available for printing.
